# HopSkipDriveCodeChallenge
A code challenge from HopSkipDrive to develop a user-friendly iOS mobile app that displays a drivers rides

As a driver, when you launch the app, you are able to see a list of all the rides available to you. Each row displaying a row also shows the following informations; 
1. The start and end time of the ride 
2. The price of the trip 
3. The number of riders on the trip 
4. The addresses(stops) on the trip 

When the driver clicks a ride, it navigates to a detail view which shows the following; 
1. A mapview showing the drop off location and the starting location 
2. The mapview also shows the path of the route 
3. The price of the trip
4. The duration of the trip in minutes 
5. etc
